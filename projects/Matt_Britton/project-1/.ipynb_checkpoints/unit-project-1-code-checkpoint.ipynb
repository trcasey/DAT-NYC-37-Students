    "When two independent variables have a high correlation, i.e. a variation in one generally results in a variation in the other. This can occur because the two variables measure the same thing, e.g. Variable A = Class Rank and Variable B = GPA. In this case, one variable is probably unnecessary. Alternatively, two variables can be related, but not identical, e.g. GRE and Prestige in this example. One would expect that students from more prestigious schools have higher GRE scores on average, but that these variables would not correlate exactly. When running a regression to determine both of their impacts on admit score, then, it is necessary to either exclude one variable, or take additional steps to analyze the relationship between the two collinear independent variables."
